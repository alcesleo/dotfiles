### Homebrew

After homebrew has been installed, run `brew bundle` from this directory.

### Vim

Install the [Lokaltog/powerline-fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts).
You might also need to set them in iTerm2's settings.

    # install vundle
    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
    vim +PluginInstall +qall


### Prompt

The `zsh_prompt` is autogenerated by [promptline.vim](https://github.com/edkolev/promptline.vim).
Settings for the prompt are in `vimrc`, change them, source it and regenerate with:

    :PromptlineSnapshot! ~/.zsh_prompt
