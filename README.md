# Dotfiles

## Introduction

*OSX, ZSH, Sublime Text 3, Prezto, Git.*

These are *my* dotfiles. Feel free to do anything you want with them,
but don't expect them to take any opinions or needs other than mine into consideration.

## Instructions

1. Set zsh as the default shell. `chsh -s zsh`
2. Install [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
3. Backup your previous configuration-files, these scripts sure as hell won't.
4. Run `dottify.sh` from your home directory
5. Set iTerm2 terminal to xterm-256 colors
