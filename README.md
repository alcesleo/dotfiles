# Dotfiles

## Introduction

*OSX, ZSH, Sublime Text 3, Prezto, Git.*

These are *my* dotfiles. Feel free to do anything you want with them,
but don't expect them to take any opinions or needs other than mine into consideration.

## Instructions

### Command-line enviornment

1. Set zsh as the default shell. `chsh -s zsh`
2. Install [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
3. Backup your previous configuration-files, these scripts sure as hell won't.
4. Run `link-dotfiles.sh`
5. Set iTerm2 terminal to xterm-256 colors

### Sublime Text 3

Instructions are in `subl/README.md`

### Other

Some OSX-configuration is in the `scripts/osx.sh`.
A bunch of commands for installing apps are there aswell.

## Notes

Next time I install OSX - PLEASE USE CASE SENSITIVE FILE SYSTEM.
